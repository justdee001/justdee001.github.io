## FEELING LOW
I am not sure, but I know what "hit rock bottom" feels like. I have faced problems before, but today the situation is weird in several ways. Not only that, I don't even have the energy to move my fingers across the keyboard. And sometimes it feels like something is sucking the energy out of me. Breakfast is on the table and is staring at me for the past two hours. I have fabric all over the room. Incomplete assignments are waiting to reach the point which is called "complete". Whiteboard looks like the desert, hopeless. If the whiteboard had life it would have given me an inspirational speech. Speech on why I should finish all the work written all over its body. Most of the time I am responsible for problems in my life. But sometimes life goes in the wrong direction. And tells you "Oh sorry, here is a small problem for you, and you can't do anything about it so live with it."  I don’t know why it feels so difficult not to dwell on the past. The concept of living here and now is interesting, but it is difficult at the same time.  Right now I am so sad that I can speak for hours about how messed up my life is and why I don’t deserve to live. But I do that to dear diary only.  I want to feel normal again. I don’t want to feel sad whenever something from the past pops up inside my dark head. Furthermore, I don’t want to regret it because I know I will not repeat my mistakes. Earlier I was in the stage where I had zero hope. I can distract my mind and do something productive. Which can create some possibilities to feel anything other than what I am feeling now and for over a year.   Respect for people who share their story of overcoming difficult situations in life. But I have my story on 'how to make life a complete mess to feel low and dismal.' which I don’t want to speak about. Struggling for over a year on overcoming regrets, sadness, guilt, loss and so many things. I have reached a point where I tried, and I want to make my life better. I want to feel normal again. To make this possible I will have to follow certain practices which will help.   I am reading THE MIRACLE MORNING - HAL ELROD and I have decided to take a challenge to improve my life. If I start telling why I want to do it then it will take me again to the dismal zone. And I will keep on describing in a detailed way, how unworthy I am as a human on planet earth. I have made routines for myself before that too several times, but I failed. Thoughts are so messed up and jumbled that I am feeling difficulty on focusing on one thing at a time. And I end up doing something which is at the bottom of the priority list like sleeping to skip dismal time.

Time to complete to the book. Then I will think how to get started.

## COMITTMENT

From tommorow I have decided to start my morning like Hal. 
* S - Silence
* A - Affirmations
* V - Visualization
* E - Exercise
* R - Reading
* S - Scribing

I will be following 10 minutes of guided meditation for silence. I have written few affirmations based on my current situations. Furthermore, I will do yoga with 5 minutes of abs workout and two laps of running. I will continue reading ‘The heartfullness ways’. Scribing is what I do on a regular basis. For the first day the sequence and time which I will follow is:
* Exercise: 10 minutes. 
* Silence: 10 minutes
* Reading: 20 minutes
* Affirmations: 5 minutes
* Visualization: 5 minutes
* Scribing: 10 mintues

I will update my progress here in this table.

    <td colspan="7">I woke up late, but I did all of it in the span of one and half hour. I did yoga for 10 minutes, then guided meditation, then read 'The heart fullness ways'. Reading took more than 30 minutes. I felt affirmation is new for me, so it will take time to get hang of it. I told little of good things to dear diary. For tomorrow, I will wake up early and will try to complete everything in one hour. Half of the things were easy, but few are different and new. The first day feels good, I don't know how fruitful it will be for my soul, but I am sure it will help.</td>

    <td colspan="7">Last night I had a fever. The head was warm and heavy. Hence, I woke up very late. Yesterday I tried waking up early, but today I did not. And I knowingly gave up on all of it. My day starts with tea. Next, I was supposed to begin with meditation, but I started reading. After completing the reading, I thought of doing meditation, searched YouTube for guided meditation. I was one step away, but I couldn't. It is not a massive deal, but I feel a bit low for this part. My body and mind automatically choose comfort, and it is like resistance or as a big wall, and at that point, all motivation efforts go to zero. From above, it seems like I failed at performing such a simple task. <br/>
But this has a positive side too. On a subconscious level, I was aware of my affirmations. I felt like I was mentally aware of what I was doing and what I was not. For tomorrow, I won't be able to wake up early as I am unfit, but I will prove my best to the rest of it.</td>
