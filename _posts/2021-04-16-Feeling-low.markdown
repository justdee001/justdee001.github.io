I am not sure but I think I know what "hit rock bottom" feels like. I have faced problems before but today the situation is weired in several ways. I dont even have energy to move my fingers across the keyboard and sometimes it feels like something is sucking energy out of me. Breakfast is on the table and is staring at me from past two hours. I have fabric all over the room, incomplete assignment are waiting to reach the point which is called "complete". White board looks like desert, hopeless. If white board had life it would have given me a inspirational speech on why I should finish all the work written all over its body. Most of the time I am responsible for problems in my life but sometimes life automatically goes in wrong direction and tells you "Oh sorry, here is a small problem for you, and you cant really do anything about it so just live with it."

I dont know why it feels so difficult to not to dwell on past. Concept of living in 'here and now' is interesting but it is difficult at the same time. 
Right now I am so sad that I can speak for hours about how messed up my life is and why I dont deserve to live. But I do that to dear diary only.

I want to feel normal again. I dont want to feel sad every time when something from past pops up inside my dark head. I dont want to regeret because I know I will not repeat my mistakes again. Earlier I was in the stage where I had zero hope. But I think I can distract my mind and do something productive which can create some possibilites in my life which will feel anything other than what I am feeling now for over a year. 

Respect for people who share their story of overcoming difficult situations in life. But sadly I have my story on 'how to make life a complete mess to feel low and dismal.' which I dont want to speak about. 
But struggling for over a year on overcoming regrets, sadness, guilt, loss and so many things I think I have reached a point where I tired and I desperately want to make my life better. I want to feel normal again. To make this possible I will have to follow certain practices which actually helps. 

I am reading THE MIRACLE MORNING - HAL ELROD and I have decided take a challenge to improve my life. If I will start telling why I want to do it then it will take me again to the zone where I will keep on describing in detailed way about how unworthy I am as a human on planet earth. I have made routines for myself before that too several times but I failed.
Honestly, thoughts are so messed up and jumbled that I am feeling difficluty on focusing at one thing at a time and I end up doing something which is at the bottom of the priority list like sleeping to skip dismal time.

Time to complete to the book. Then I will think how to get started.
