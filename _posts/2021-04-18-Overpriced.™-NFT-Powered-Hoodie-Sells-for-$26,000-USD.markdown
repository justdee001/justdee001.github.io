#### Overpriced.™ sold its first  piece that is a hoodie from its ultra-limited collection for $26,000 USD on Blockparty.co which makes it the most expensive hoodie ever sold. 
 


Overpriced.™  is  Founded in 2021 by James Zwadlo and Chris Levett (Cofounders of the much-acclaimed creative agency Impossible Brief) & Leighton James (one half of the famed electronic music production duo Adventure Club), Overpriced.™ is the first high-end fashion brand powered by NFT.

Here is the caption from a video explainer:
<br/>
<p style="font-family:monospace;">“From the minds of Impossible briefs comes a premium streetwear brand where a garments value is held within the digital realm and not the physical one. We are the worlds first true NFT-Driven fashion brand.


A revolutionary approach where the NFT holds the true value rather than the garment. The NFT that you can wear. This is flexing for the new generation. We believe that an NFT’s journey creates its legacy, story and ultimately value.<i style="background-color:#FDFFBA;"> Allowing anyone with the smartphone to scan the custom v-code on your garment will take them to your pieces’s NFT meta-portal.</i><br/>
On here, they can peep the garment’s data, history and provenance. 
NFT meta-portal data includes: Serial no. ,Current owner, value the NFT was last bought for, cumulative value the NFT was sold for.
<br/>
<i style="background-color:#FDFFBA;"> And most importantly if the NFT + garment are authentic. This is achieved through combination of both: our patent pending technology and Microstructure scanning capabilities. Therefore solving one of the biggest problems to ever plague the fashion industry: Fraud.</i> <br/>
Should you ever loose your garment, damage it, or have it stolen: We will invalidate that NFT: instantly making that garment fake. We will then send you the new one. 
Our mission is to drop ultra-limited garments based on scarcity, exclusivity and hype to determine the metrics of an item’s worth on both ends on the price spectrum. 
Season 1 will be an ultra-limited run of 25 unique pieces.  Only 10 will go on public NFT auctions.”</p>
